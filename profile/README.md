> "Practical cyber-physical security: We hack, we patch, we secure real-world systems."

Our research group focuses on addressing cybersecurity challenges across diverse interdisciplinary domains.
Our primary goal is to enhance the security and robustness of a wide spectrum of computer systems,
ranging from traditional software and operating systems to emerging systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems
(e.g., drones, autonomous vehicles, satellite systems) and Artificial Intelligence systems.

Our research methodology encompasses various approaches, including, but not limited to:
1. Developing automated methodologies for scalable bug identification.
2. Exploring offensive techniques to diagnose vulnerabilities in existing systems.
3. Engineering secure and robust systems.

Ultimately, our overarching goal is to make practical impacts on the cyber-physical safety of individuals who rely on computer-based systems in their daily lives.
